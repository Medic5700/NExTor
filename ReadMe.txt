A prototype for a new torrent protocol, hopefully more... easy to use/code for, then the regular torrent protocol.
Mainly want to learn more about the torrent protocol, implement a couple ideas, etc.
Since this is a theoretical project, any shortcuts will be kept to a minimum since performance will be of lower priority to understandability.
